# Credit Approval System
The Credit Approval System is a project developed using Python, Django, Postgres, and Docker, designed to streamline the credit evaluation process and facilitate banking-related operations. This project encompasses a robust backend system comprising multiple APIs for assessing credit scores, managing user data, and processing loan applications. Leveraging Docker, the entire project is containerized to ensure seamless deployment and version compatibility.
